Lecture 5.1. 

Many reasons why user would want to restrict access to a source. 
- privledged users to change code
- sensitive data
- limit 

API keys is a common way to restrict access. 
    - Don't put API keys on github. 
    - Code scanning for this always. 
    - Apply key from resouce holder.

- Include API in the request 
    - get request (old) not secure 
    - or put in a header, get request auth: header. 

- html to PDF. 

- github is an API also 

- OAuth 1 and OAuth 2 
    - 2 legged : Resource owner of techy can 
    - 3 legged 


USING PACKAGES:
- Packages can be used to interact with APIs
- Look up python api modules
- any-api.com (shows the APIS that are available )

What is lecture 5.3. telling me : Look up packages with python to interact with an API.
